                                                    Phonebook Management System
This is a  program that can be used to manage a list of phonebook contacts. The program is written in the C programming language and uses a technique called "file handling" to store and retrieve the contact information.

To use the program, you need to compile the source code using a C compiler (such as zsh or bash) and then run the resulting executable file. 
The program will present a menu of options:
1)Add contacts: This option allows us to add contact
2)List contacts: This option allows us to add contact
3)Search contacts: This option allows us to add contact
4)Quit: This option allows us to add contact

All the contacts information is stored in a text file called phonebook.txt
